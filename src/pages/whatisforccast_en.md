FORCCAST : Formation par la cartographie des controverses à l’analyse des sciences et des techniques / Training Through Mapping of Controversies by Analyzing Science and Technical Innovation

The Forccast program is a laureate of the call for projects on Initiatives of Excellence in Innovative Training (Initiatives d’excellence en formations innovantes (IDEFI) of the French National Agency for Research. It is financed from 2012 through 2019.

Forccast includes fourteen higher education and research institutions. Among its partners are institutions from both higher and lower education, specialized in social and engineering sciences in France and abroad. SciencesPo hosts the Forccast project.

Forccast’s activities focus on the interactions between science, technology and society (STS). The program’s goal is to train different audiences on the exploration of contemporary controversies, which emanate from the massive proliferation of scientific and technical innovations.
